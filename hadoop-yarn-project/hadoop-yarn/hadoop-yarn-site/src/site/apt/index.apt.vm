MapReduce NextGen aka YARN aka MRv2

  The new architecture introduced in hadoop-0.23, divides the two major 
  functions of the JobTracker: resource management and job life-cycle management 
  into separate components.

  The new ResourceManager manages the global assignment of compute resources to 
  applications and the per-application ApplicationMaster manages the 
  applicationâ€™s scheduling and coordination. 
  
  An application is either a single job in the sense of classic MapReduce jobs 
  or a DAG of such jobs. 
  
  The ResourceManager and per-machine NodeManager daemon, which manages the 
  user processes on that machine, form the computation fabric. 
  
  The per-application ApplicationMaster is, in effect, a framework specific 
  library and is tasked with negotiating resources from the ResourceManager and 
  working with the NodeManager(s) to execute and monitor the tasks.

  More details are available in the {{{./YARN.html}YARN}}
  document.
