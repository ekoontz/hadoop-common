    <title>Fault Injection Framework and Development Guide</title>
  </header>

  <body>
    <section>
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>This guide provides an overview of the Hadoop Fault Injection (FI) framework for those
      who will be developing their own faults (aspects).
      </p>
      <p>The idea of fault injection is fairly simple: it is an
        infusion of errors and exceptions into an application's logic to
        achieve a higher coverage and fault tolerance of the system.
        Different implementations of this idea are available today.
        Hadoop's FI framework is built on top of Aspect Oriented Paradigm
        (AOP) implemented by AspectJ toolkit.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Assumptions</title>
      <p>The current implementation of the FI framework assumes that the faults it
        will be emulating are of non-deterministic nature. That is,  the moment
        of a fault's happening isn't known in advance and is a coin-flip based.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Architecture of the Fault Injection Framework</title>

      <section>
        <title>Configuration Management</title>
        <p>This piece of the FI framework allows you to set expectations for faults to happen. 
        The settings can be applied either statically (in advance) or in runtime. 
        The desired level of faults in the framework can be configured two ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            editing
            <code>src/aop/fi-site.xml</code>
            configuration file. This file is similar to other Hadoop's config
            files
          </li>
          <li>
            setting system properties of JVM through VM startup parameters or in
            <code>build.properties</code>
            file
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <title>Probability Model</title>
        <p>This is fundamentally a coin flipper. The methods of this class are
          getting a random number between 0.0
          and 1.0 and then checking if a new number has happened in the
          range of 0.0 and a configured level for the fault in question. If that
          condition is true then the fault will occur.
        </p>
        <p>Thus, to guarantee the happening of a fault one needs to set an
          appropriate level to 1.0.
          To completely prevent a fault from happening its probability level
          has to be set to 0.0.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: The default probability level is set to 0
          (zero) unless the level is changed explicitly through the
          configuration file or in the runtime. The name of the default
          level's configuration parameter is
          <code>fi.*</code>
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <title>Fault Injection Mechanism: AOP and AspectJ</title>
        <p>The foundation of Hadoop's FI framework includes a
          cross-cutting concept implemented by AspectJ. The following basic
          terms are important to remember:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>A cross-cutting concept</strong>
            (aspect) is behavior, and often data, that is used across the scope
            of a piece of software
          </li>
          <li>In AOP, the
            <strong>aspects</strong>
            provide a mechanism by which a cross-cutting concern can be
            specified in a modular way
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advice</strong>
            is the
            code that is executed when an aspect is invoked
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Join point</strong>
            (or pointcut) is a specific
            point within the application that may or not invoke some advice
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <title>Existing Join Points</title>
        <p>
          The following readily available join points are provided by AspectJ:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Join when a method is called
          </li>
          <li>Join during a method's execution
          </li>
          <li>Join when a constructor is invoked
          </li>
          <li>Join during a constructor's execution
          </li>
          <li>Join during aspect advice execution
          </li>
          <li>Join before an object is initialized
          </li>
          <li>Join during object initialization
          </li>
          <li>Join during static initializer execution
          </li>
          <li>Join when a class's field is referenced
          </li>
          <li>Join when a class's field is assigned
          </li>
          <li>Join when a handler is executed
          </li>
        </ul>

      <title>Aspect Example</title>
      <source>
package org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode;

import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;
import org.apache.hadoop.fi.ProbabilityModel;
import org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.DataNode;
import org.apache.hadoop.util.DiskChecker.*;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.DataOutputStream;

/**
* This aspect takes care about faults injected into datanode.BlockReceiver
* class
*/
public aspect BlockReceiverAspects {
  public static final Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(BlockReceiverAspects.class);

  public static final String BLOCK_RECEIVER_FAULT="hdfs.datanode.BlockReceiver";
    pointcut callReceivePacket() : call (* OutputStream.write(..))
      &amp;&amp; withincode (* BlockReceiver.receivePacket(..))
    // to further limit the application of this aspect a very narrow 'target' can be used as follows
    // &amp;&amp; target(DataOutputStream)
      &amp;&amp; !within(BlockReceiverAspects +);

  before () throws IOException : callReceivePacket () {
    if (ProbabilityModel.injectCriteria(BLOCK_RECEIVER_FAULT)) {
      LOG.info("Before the injection point");
      Thread.dumpStack();
      throw new DiskOutOfSpaceException ("FI: injected fault point at " +
      thisJoinPoint.getStaticPart( ).getSourceLocation());
    }
  }
}
</source>

      <p>The aspect has two main parts: </p>
       <ul>
        <li>The join point
        <code>pointcut callReceivepacket()</code>
        which servers as an identification mark of a specific point (in control
        and/or data flow) in the life of an application. </li>
        
       <li> A call to the advice -
        <code>before () throws IOException : callReceivepacket()</code>
        - will be injected (see
        <a href="#Putting+it+all+together">Putting It All Together</a>)
        before that specific spot of the application's code.</li>
        </ul>
      

      <p>The pointcut identifies an invocation of class'
        <code>java.io.OutputStream write()</code>
        method
        with any number of parameters and any return type. This invoke should
        take place within the body of method
        <code>receivepacket()</code>
        from class<code>BlockReceiver</code>.
        The method can have any parameters and any return type. 
        Possible invocations of
        <code>write()</code>
        method happening anywhere within the aspect
        <code>BlockReceiverAspects</code>
        or its heirs will be ignored.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Note 1</strong>: This short example doesn't illustrate
        the fact that you can have more than a single injection point per
        class. In such a case the names of the faults have to be different
        if a developer wants to trigger them separately.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Note 2</strong>: After the injection step (see
        <a href="#Putting+it+all+together">Putting It All Together</a>)
        you can verify that the faults were properly injected by
        searching for <code>ajc</code> keywords in a disassembled class file.
      </p>

    <section>
      <title>Fault Naming Convention and Namespaces</title>
      <p>For the sake of a unified naming
      convention the following two types of names are recommended for a
      new aspects development:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Activity specific notation 
          (when we don't care about a particular location of a fault's
          happening). In this case the name of the fault is rather abstract:
          <code>fi.hdfs.DiskError</code>
        </li>
        <li>Location specific notation.
          Here, the fault's name is mnemonic as in:
          <code>fi.hdfs.datanode.BlockReceiver[optional location details]</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Development Tools</title>
      <ul>
        <li>The Eclipse
          <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/">AspectJ Development Toolkit</a> 
          may help you when developing aspects
        </li>
        <li>IntelliJ IDEA provides AspectJ weaver and Spring-AOP plugins
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Putting It All Together</title>
      <p>Faults (aspects) have to injected (or woven) together before
        they can be used. Follow these instructions:</p>
        
    <ul>
      <li>To weave aspects in place use:
<source>
% ant injectfaults
</source>
      </li>
      
      <li>If you
        misidentified the join point of your aspect you will see a
        warning (similar to the one shown here) when 'injectfaults' target is
        completed:
<source>
[iajc] warning at
src/test/aop/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/datanode/ \
          BlockReceiverAspects.aj:44::0
advice defined in org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.BlockReceiverAspects
has not been applied [Xlint:adviceDidNotMatch]
</source>
        </li>
        
      <li>It isn't an error, so the build will report the successful result. <br />
     To prepare dev.jar file with all your faults weaved in place (HDFS-475 pending) use:
<source>
% ant jar-fault-inject
</source>
        </li>

     <li>To create test jars use:
<source>
% ant jar-test-fault-inject
</source>
      </li>

     <li>To run HDFS tests with faults injected use:
<source>
% ant run-test-hdfs-fault-inject
</source>
      </li>
    </ul>
        
      <section>
        <title>How to Use the Fault Injection Framework</title>
        <p>Faults can be triggered as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>During runtime:
<source>
% ant run-test-hdfs -Dfi.hdfs.datanode.BlockReceiver=0.12
</source>
            To set a certain level, for example 25%, of all injected faults use:
            <br/>
<source>
% ant run-test-hdfs-fault-inject -Dfi.*=0.25
</source>
          </li>
          <li>From a program:
  
        <source>
package org.apache.hadoop.fs;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.Before;

public class DemoFiTest {
  public static final String BLOCK_RECEIVER_FAULT="hdfs.datanode.BlockReceiver";
  @Override
  @Before
  public void setUp() {
    //Setting up the test's environment as required
  }

  @Test
  public void testFI() {
    // It triggers the fault, assuming that there's one called 'hdfs.datanode.BlockReceiver'
    System.setProperty("fi." + BLOCK_RECEIVER_FAULT, "0.12");
    //
    // The main logic of your tests goes here
    //
    // Now set the level back to 0 (zero) to prevent this fault from happening again
    System.setProperty("fi." + BLOCK_RECEIVER_FAULT, "0.0");
    // or delete its trigger completely
    System.getProperties().remove("fi." + BLOCK_RECEIVER_FAULT);
  }

  @Override
  @After
  public void tearDown() {
    //Cleaning up test test environment
  }
}
</source>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          As you can see above these two methods do the same thing. They are
          setting the probability level of <code>hdfs.datanode.BlockReceiver</code>
          at 12%. The difference, however, is that the program provides more
          flexibility and allows you to turn a fault off when a test no longer needs it.
