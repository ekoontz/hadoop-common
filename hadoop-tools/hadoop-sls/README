Yarn Scheduler Load Simulator (SLS)

SLS is a stress and performance harness for the Yarn Resource Manager Scheduler
that exercises the scheduler implementation simulating the cluster size and the
applications load without having to have a cluster nor applications.

SLS runs a regular RM without RPC endpoints and uses a NodeManager and
Application Manager simulators to send and receive events simulating cluster
and application load behavior.

The size of the cluster and the application load is scripted in a configuration
file.
